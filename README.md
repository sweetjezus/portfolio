# Personal Portfolio Website

This project consists of a personal portfolio website designed to present my profile as a Junior Web Developer, along with a dynamic and modern user interface. The website allows visitors to navigate through multiple sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact, with smooth transitions and responsive layout. The Projects section is populated dynamically using Firebase Firestore and Storage, allowing real-time updates of project content and images. The Contact section includes a fully functional contact form that sends emails via EmailJS. The interface was crafted with a focus on user experience and modern design trends, including animated gradients, interactive buttons, and glassmorphism effects. This project highlights both my technical and creative skills as a developer.
